This project uses the Mastra framework for building AI agents in TypeScript.

Follow Mastra conventions for agent structure, tools, and workflows.

Use Langfuse for observability and tracking agent interactions.

Organize code with clear folder structure: separate agents, tools, and utilities into their own directories.

Include comments explaining what each section of code does, especially for TypeScript types and interfaces.

When installing dependencies, explain what each package does and why we need it.
